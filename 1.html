  What Is HTML? Hypertext Markup Language Basics Explained
  <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard
   markup language for web page creation. It allows the creation
   and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML
   elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes.</p><p style="margin-top:40px;">
    HTML has a lot of use cases, namely:
    Web development. Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays
     web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files.
    Internet navigation. Users can easily navigate and insert links between
    related pages and websites as HTML is heavily used to embed hyperlinks.
    Web documentation. HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents,
    similarly to Microsoft Word.

    It’s also worth noting that HTML is not considered a programming language
    as it can’t create dynamic functionality. It is now considered an official
    web standard. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) maintains and develops HTML
    specifications, along with providing regular updates.</p>
